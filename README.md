# Advanced Port Scanning Detection Techniques for Network Security: PortHunter

## Project Overview

This research project, "Advanced Port Scanning Detection Techniques for Network Security," aims to develop a smarter and more reliable system for detecting port scanning attacks, including stealthy and distributed techniques, to strengthen network security and keep systems safe. Traditional security tools often struggle to detect slower, more strategic scans designed to evade detection. Our approach leverages real-time traffic monitoring, anomaly detection, and machine learning to overcome these limitations.

## Problem Statement

Attackers frequently employ port scanning to silently explore systems, searching for open ports and active services to exploit. Existing security tools often miss slow or distributed scans. [cite_start]This project addresses the critical need for a more efficient and accurate method to identify and mitigate these stealthy scanning attempts, which can otherwise go unnoticed.

## Technologies and Tools Used

### Technologies:
* Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) 
* Machine Learning Algorithms 
* Packet Analysis Tools 
* Statistical Anomaly Detection Techniques 
* Cryptographic Techniques for Secure Monitoring 

### Tools:
* Wireshark (Network Traffic Analysis) 
* Snort (IDS) 
* Nmap (Port Scanning Tool) 
* ZMap, Masscan, Unicornscan (High-speed Network Scanning) 
* Python (For Implementation and Analysis) 
* MATLAB (For Statistical Analysis) 
* MySQL (Database for Storing Traffic Logs) 

## Literature Survey Insights

Our research is informed by key insights from the literature:
* Traditional IDSs like Snort are vulnerable to slow port scanning due to their reliance on fixed time windows.
* A smarter approach involves categorizing IP behaviors (normal, suspicious, scanner) based on network traffic analysis to improve detection accuracy and uncover stealthy scans.
* Analyzing the unique traces left by various port scanning tools can help remotely identify the tool being used, providing valuable threat intelligence.
* The findings also indicate that certain tools, such as Masscan and ZMap, are more commonly used in specific regions, suggesting distinct attacker strategies and targets across different parts of the world.
* Detecting port scanning can be enhanced by looking for unusual changes in network traffic using statistical methods and mathematical models to classify IP behavior.

## Project Description

This project aims to enhance port scanning detection through real-time traffic monitoring, anomaly detection, and machine learning. [cite_start]By continuously monitoring network activity in short intervals and utilizing probability-based analysis, the system can quickly and accurately identify slow or distributed scans while significantly reducing false alarms. [cite_start]This approach strengthens security without imposing excessive strain on system resources.

## Project Modules

### Design Algorithm:
* **Feature Extraction:** Extracting relevant features from network traffic, such as SYN-ACK response ratio, failed connection attempts, and packet rates.
* **Classification:** Employing machine learning models (e.g., k-means clustering, decision trees) for classification.
* **Adaptive Thresholding:** Implementing adaptive thresholds to detect anomalies over time.

### Implementation Methodology:
* **Traffic Capture:** Capturing live network traffic using Wireshark.
* **Traffic Analysis:** Analyzing captured traffic using Python and statistical tools.
* **Model Training:** Training the machine learning model with labeled datasets (normal vs. malicious traffic).
* **System Deployment:** Deploying a real-time detection system integrated with an alert mechanism.

## Results & Conclusion

The developed system demonstrates significant improvements:
* It effectively minimized false alarms, making it much better at detecting slow port scans than traditional intrusion detection methods.
* With the help of machine learning, it could spot unusual network activity more accurately, improving overall detection performance.
* It also worked in real time without putting too much strain on resources, making it a practical choice for large-scale networks.

## Future Scope & Enhancements

* Integration with cloud-based monitoring systems for real-time attack mitigation.
* Expansion to detect additional reconnaissance techniques beyond port scanning.
* Adaptive learning models that improve accuracy over time.

## Advantages of This Project

* Increased detection accuracy with minimal false positives.
* Real-time monitoring capabilities.
* Scalable solution for enterprise-level cybersecurity.

## Outcome

A functional port scanning detection system that outperforms traditional IDS in detecting slow and distributed scans.
